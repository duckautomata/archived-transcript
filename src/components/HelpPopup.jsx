                                    You can search for when something was said and in what stream it was said in. You
                                    can also use filters to refine your search.

                                    Match Whole Word means it will not include any substrings of your search text. For
                                    example: say you search for &#34;ball&#34;. If Match Whole Word is enabled, then it
                                    will only return results for &#34;ball&#34; and not &#34;balls&#34; or

                                    If search text is empty, then it will try to find all streams that match the filter,
                                    but return no text.

                                    You can graph word or phase usage over time. There are two types of graph:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Across multiple streams</li>
                                        <li>Across a single stream</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                                    The multi-stream graph can be accessed by clicking the graph button in the sidebar.
                                    The single-stream graph can only be accessed by clicking the &#34;Graph This
                                    Stream&#34; button on the search page.
                                </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                                    Graphing functions the same as searching, with the only difference being you view a
                                    graph instead of a list of streams.
                                </Typography>
                                <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                                    Once graphed, you can switch between a cumulative sum or a rate over time (default).
